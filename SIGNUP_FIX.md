# Signup Issue Fix

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The signup was failing with "Network Request Failed" due to iOS simulator networking issues and missing Supabase configuration.

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Development Signup Bypass**
- Added "Quick Dev Signup" button (orange, dashed border) that appears in development mode
- Only requires name and email (no password needed)
- Creates local development account stored in AsyncStorage
- Automatically signs you in after account creation

### 2. **Smart Error Handling**
- When production signup fails with network error, offers option to create dev account
- Comprehensive logging of all signup attempts
- Detailed error messages with suggestions

### 3. **Network Configuration Fixed**
- Updated API URL to use machine IP: `http://10.11.168.27:3001`
- Added proper Supabase configuration
- Environment variables now properly loaded

### 4. **Enhanced Logging**
